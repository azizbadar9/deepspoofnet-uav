Libraries Used

1-Numpy V1.26.0 (working with arrays. It also has functions for working in domain of linear algebra, fourier transform, and matrices. )
2- Pandas 2.1.1 (working with data sets. It has functions for analyzing, cleaning, exploring, and manipulating data. The name "Pandas" has a reference to both "Panel Data", and "Python Data Analysis")
3- Seaborn 0.13.0 (visualize random distributions.)
4- Matplotlib 3.8.0 (creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.)
5- TensorFlow 2.14.0 (TensorFlow can be used to develop models for various tasks, including natural language processing, image recognition, handwriting recognition, and different computational-based simulations such as partial differential equations.)
6- Keras 2.14.0 (Keras is a high-level, deep learning API developed by Google for implementing neural networks.)
7- scikit-learn 1.3 (to implement machine learning models and statistical modeling.)

Note 
Pip install will command in folder directory will install all the third party and native libraries.

Each file of pybook has separate Modal and and its combination with feature selection method.


Dataset Creation
Install ulog plugin and give the path of ulog files in both directories of spoofed and benign. 

Link

This is extract flight data from both ulog files merge both files and remove NAN values and use SMOTE for data balancing.
